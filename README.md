# awesome-board
Digital solution for an Awesome Board a.k.a. Spotify Improvement Board a.k.a. Toyota Improvement Kata

## Quick Start
**The following instructions are intended to be executed via the terminal**

1. Make sure npm is installed
  1. We recommend using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
    * If you don't have homebrew already, you can install it using `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
    * Once homebrew is installed, install node and type `brew install node`
  1. To check if node was properly installed, type `node -v`. This will print the version in `v0.0.0` format
  1. To check if npm was properly installed, type `npm -v`. This will print the version in `0.0.0` format
    * **NOTE: If you already had homebrew and node installed, we recommend you ensure they are up-to-date**
      1. `brew update`
      1. `brew upgrade node`
1. Make sure mongodb is installed
  * Again, we recommend homebrew - type `brew install mongodb` (or one of the other options [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/))
  * Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#run-mongodb) the first time you run mongodb to make sure your machine is set up for it
1. Clone the code to your workstation - `git clone https://github.com/walmart-technology-cps/awesome-board.git` - and cd into it - `cd awesome-board`
1. Make sure mongodb is running by typing `mongod &`
1. Type `npm install` - this will pull all of the dependencies found in the package.json file
1. To start the awesome-hubot Slack connection with express server running backend, first you need to replace `{token_goes_here}` with your slack API token, it is located in /bin/hubot-slack file.
Then type `npm start` to start.
  * To exit awesome-hubot slack connection, type `exit`
  * To stop the server, press <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
1. Start the express server by typing `npm run board`
  * The UI will be accessible via [http://localhost:3000/#/home.html](http://localhost:3000/#/home.html)
  * To stop the server, press <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
1. Start the awesome-hubot by typing `npm run hubot`
  * To exit awesome-hubot CLI, type `exit`
1. Start the awesome-hubot CLI for development with express server running backend by typing `npm run dev`
  * To exit awesome-hubot CLI, type `exit`
  * To stop the server, press <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

## Slack Integration
Some of the functionality in the Slack integration requires that the bot be set up as part of an app, not a custom integration. To set this up, follow these steps:
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create New App"
2. Enable the bot for your app via "Bot Users" under the "Features" side menu
3. Install the app on the Slack team of your choice via "Install App" under the "Settings" side menu
  * The "Bot User OAuth Access Token" is the token that you'll need to use for the SLACK_TOKEN Environment Variable listed below

## Parameterization
